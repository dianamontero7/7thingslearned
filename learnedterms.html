<h1 id="this is a heading">Repository</h1>
<p>A repository is like a home base for your project’s files, keeping everything organized in one place. It also tracks all the changes made over time, so you can always look back and see how things evolved.</p>


<h1 id="this is a heading">Version Control</h1>
<p>Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to files over time, making it easy to go back to a previous version whenever needed. Whether you're working solo or collaborating with a team, it helps keep everything organized and prevents accidental mistakes.</p>

<h1 id="this is a heading">Commit</h1>
<p>A commit is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific moment, saving all the changes you've made. It lets you track progress, roll back if needed, and keep your work organized as you go.</p>

<h1 id="this is a heading">Branch</h1>
<p>A branch is like a separate workspace in a repository where you can experiment with new ideas without messing up the main project. It lets you work on changes independently, and once everything looks good, you can merge it back into the main code.</p>

<h1 id="this is a heading">Git</h1>
<p>Git is a super efficient, distributed version control system that’s perfect for projects of all sizes, from small to massive ones. It’s designed to help you manage code with speed and ease, making collaboration a breeze no matter the scale of the project.</p>

<h1 id="this is a heading">Git Clone</h1>
<p>A git clone is a command used to make a copy of a repository into a new directory on your local machine. It’s a quick way to get started with a project by duplicating all of its files and history.</p>

<h1 id="this is a heading">Git Push</h1>
<p>To upload your files from your local machine to the remote repository, just use the git push command. This sends your changes to the online project, so everyone else can see the latest version.</p>
